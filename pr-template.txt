This Pull Request has been generated automatically by awesome-lists-bot, which was created by @ColinEberhardt. The aim of this bot is to improve the overall standard of the various GitHub-based 'awesome' lists.

For questions / comments regarding the bot, or to have your awesome repo removed from the list, please add an issue here:

https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/awesome-lists-bot

Currently the bot does the following:

- Removes links that returns 404s (please double check these deletions before merging in case it is a temporary issue)
- Add a star count for repos, this helps people find popular projects (especially useful for big lists!)
- Resolve redirects, updating the project / org name when a redirect is found.

Although I am beta-testing some of these features on a subset of awesome lists.
